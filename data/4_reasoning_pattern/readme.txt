Because we already generated the data before, so we are going to reuse the dataset.
For connectivity, we use semantic_data/connectivity/train and test data.
For topological sort, we use structural_data/topology/type/ER/train and test data.
For shortest path, we use structural_data/shortest_path/type/ER/train and test data.
For maximum flow, we use numerical_data/flow/sint_train and test data.
