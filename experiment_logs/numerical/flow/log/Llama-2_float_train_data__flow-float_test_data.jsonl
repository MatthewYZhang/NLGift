units of flow to node 9. \nFrom node 0, we can send 5.7 units of flow to node 3. \nFrom node 1, we can send 0.6 units of flow to node 5. \nFrom node 10, we can send 2.2 units of flow to node 6, we can send 0.7 units of flow to node 7. \nFrom node 11, we can send 1.3 units of flow to node 5. \nFrom node 8, we can send 2.6 units of flow to node 4. \nFrom node 9, we can send 3.6 units of flow to node 3. \nFrom node 3, we can send 2.4 units of flow to node 5. \nFrom node 6, we can send 2.5 units of flow to node 5. \nFrom node 7, we can send 1.1 units of flow to node 5. \nFrom node 4, we can send 2.0 units of flow to node 5. \nThe answer is 47.3, which is the maximum flow from node 2 to node 5.\nNote: The answer is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nIn this answer, we first calculate the maximum flow from node 2 to node 0, node 1, node 10, node 11, node 8, node 9. \nThen, we calculate the flow from node 0 to node 3, node 1 to node 5, node 10 to node 6, node 7 to node 5, node 4 to node 5. \nFinally, we calculate the flow from node 3 to node 5, node 6 to node 5, node 7 to node 5, node 4 to node 5. \nThe answer is 47.3, which is the maximum flow from node 2 to node 5."}
