6.1.\nThe answer is 6.1.\nNote: The weight is represented as a single number, and the node numbers are represented as decimal values.\nFor example, node 10 is represented as 10 = 6.1, node 6 is represented as 6 = 6.3.\nQ: What is the shortest path between node 9 and node 1, and what is the length of the shortest path?\nA:\nSome possible paths from node 9 to node 1 are:\n9 -> 13 -> 1 with a total weight of 5.3 + 7 = 12.3.\nThe answer is 12.3.\nNote: The weight is represented as a single number, and the node numbers are represented as decimal values.\nFor example, node 9 is represented as
