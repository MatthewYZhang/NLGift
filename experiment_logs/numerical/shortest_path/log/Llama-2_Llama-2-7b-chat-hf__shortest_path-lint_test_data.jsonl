We can do this by using a vector `d` to keep track of the distances of each node:\n```\nd = [0, 15, 22, 0]\n```\nThis means that the distance from node 1 to node 2 is 0, and the distance from node 1 to node 3 is 15, and so on.\n\nNext, we need to find the distance of each node from the destination node (node 4).

It returns a vector `distance` containing the distances of each node to the destination node.\n\nThe length of the shortest path between node 4 and node 3 is the sum of the distances of each node in the path:\n```\nlength = sum(distance)\n```\nTherefore, the shortest path between node 4 and node 3 has a length of 37 (15 + 22 + 0)."}

To find the shortest path between node 4 and node 3 in this undirected graph with weights, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nThe weight of the shortest path between node 4 and node 3 is 95, as you mentioned in the question.\n\nHere's how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\n\n1. Initialize the distance of the starting node (node 4 in this case) to 0.\n2. Initialize a priority queue to hold the nodes to be processed.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, dequeue the node with the highest distance.\n4. If the dequeued node is the destination node (node 3 in this case), then print the shortest path and exit.\n5. Otherwise, update the distance of the dequeued node to the minimum of its current distance and the weight of the edge connecting it to its neighbor.\n6. Add the neighbor of the dequeued node to the priority queue.\n\nSince the weight of the shortest path between node 4 and node 3 is 95, we can start by initializing the distance of node 4 to 0, and the distance of node 3 to infinity. Then, we can use the priority queue to find the shortest path between node 4 and node 3.\n\nThe shortest path between node 4 and node 3 is:\n\n4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3\n\nThe length of the shortest path is 95.\n\nI hope this helps!

To find the shortest path between node 0 and node 1 in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nFirst, let's represent the graph as an adjacency matrix, where the value at position (i, j) represents the weight of the edge between nodes i and j. In this case, the matrix would look like this:\n\n| 20 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 0 | 20 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 20 | 0 |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 20 |\n\nNext, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between node 0 and node 1. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority of each node is its distance from the starting node (node 0).\n\nWe start by adding node 0 to the priority queue, with a distance of 0. Then, we repeatedly remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue, and update the distances of its neighbors. When we remove a node, we add its neighbors to the priority queue if their distances to the starting node are smaller than the node's current distance.\n\nAfter running the algorithm, we find that the shortest path between node 0 and node 1 is (0, 20), with a distance of 20.\n\nI hope this helps!

Let's use a dictionary to store these distances:\n\n{0: 65, 1: 65, 2: 81, 3: 12}\n\nNow, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3. The algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the distance from the starting node to the destination node, and updating the distances in the dictionary accordingly.\n\nHere are the distances and the corresponding nodes at each step of the algorithm:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the distance from node 0 to node 3 to 12 (since the only path between node 0 and node 3 is through nodes 1 and 2).\n\n{0: 12, 1: 65, 2: 81, 3: 12}\n\nStep 2: Relax the distance from node 0 to node 1 to 65 (since the weight between node 0 and node 1 is 65).\n\n{0: 12, 1: 65, 2: 81, 3: 12}\n\nStep 3: Relax the distance from node 1 to node 0 to 65 (since the weight between node 1 and node 0 is 65).\n\n{0: 77, 1: 65, 2: 81, 3: 12}\n\nStep 4: Relax the distance from node 2 to node 0 to 81 (since the weight between node 2 and node 0 is 81).\n\n{0: 88, 1: 65, 2: 81, 3: 12}\n\nStep 5: Relax the distance from node 3 to node 0 to 12 (since the weight between node 3 and node 0 is 12).\n\n{0: 99, 1: 65, 2: 81, 3: 12}\n\nThe shortest path between node 0 and node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 3}, and the length of the shortest path is 99."}
