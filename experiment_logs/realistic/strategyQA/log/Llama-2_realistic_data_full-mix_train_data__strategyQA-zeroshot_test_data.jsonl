While he made significant contributions to American history and culture, he also held views that are now widely recognized as racist and discriminatory.\n\nHowever, the solution to addressing these issues is not to remove statues or erase historical figures from society. Rather, it is to engage in open and honest dialogue about the past, to acknowledge the harm that has been done, and to work towards a more equitable and just society for all. This can involve educating ourselves and others about the history of racism and discrimination, advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, and working to dismantle systems of oppression.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question is no, Benjamin Franklin is not a prime candidate for removal by the Black Lives Matter movement. Instead, we should focus on engaging in meaningful conversations and actions that promote equity, inclusion, and social justice for all."}
