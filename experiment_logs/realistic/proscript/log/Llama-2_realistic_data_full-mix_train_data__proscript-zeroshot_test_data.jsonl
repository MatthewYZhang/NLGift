This can be done by visually scanning the wall to identify any paintings that appear to be crooked or askew.\n\n1 -> walk up to paintings:\nOnce the paintings have been located, walk up to them to get a closer look and assess their straightness.\n\n2 -> touch paintings with hand:\nGently touch each painting with your hand to get a better sense of its shape and determine the extent of its crookedness.\n\n3 -> eyeball what perfectly horizontal level:\nLook at each painting and determine if it is at a perfectly horizontal level. If it is not, you can use this information to decide the best way to straighten it.\n\n4 -> move hand toward paintings:\nBased on your assessment of each painting, move your hand toward it in a gentle, sweeping motion to determine the extent of its crookedness.\n\n5 -> decide to Straighten paintings on wall:\nAfter assessing each painting, decide whether or not to straighten it. If the painting is only slightly crooked, it may not be worth straightening. However, if it is significantly askew, you should proceed to the next steps.\n\n6 -> Straighten paintings on wall:\nIf you have decided to straighten a painting, use your hand to slowly and carefully move it into the desired position.

This involves setting the intention to move the foot.\n2. step1: Reduce the lifting speed once over the surface -> Once the desire to lift the foot has been formed, the next step is to reduce the lifting speed once over the surface. This is done by slowing down the movement of the foot as it approaches the surface.\n3. step2: Apply extra force to resist gravity -> The next step is to apply extra force to resist gravity. This involves using the muscles in the foot to generate additional force to overcome the force of gravity and lift the foot off the ground.\n4. step4: Bring the foot to a stop mid-air -> After applying extra force to resist gravity, the next step is to bring the foot to a stop mid-air. This involves slowing down the movement of the foot to a complete stop in mid-air.\n5. step5: decide to Put up feet -> Once the foot has been lifted off the ground, the next step is to decide to put up the feet. This involves directing the feet towards the ground and preparing to land safely.\n6. step3: Will that the body activates the lifting muscles -> Before deciding to put up the feet, the next step is to will that the body activates the lifting muscles. This involves focusing one's intention on activating the muscles in the foot to lift the foot further.\n7. step6: lift the right foot -> The final step is to lift the right foot. This involves using the activated lifting muscles to lift the foot off the ground and maintain its position in mid-air.\n8. step7: decide to land safely -> After lifting the foot, the next step is to decide to land safely.

Clean bottles and remove labels -> step1. Collect bottles from acquaintances\n\nIn this step, you gather beer bottles from friends, family, or colleagues who are willing to donate their empty bottles for your project. You can ask them directly or post a message on social media or a local group to gather as many bottles as possible.\n\n1. Collect bottles from acquaintances -> step0. Clean bottles and remove labels\n\nOnce you have collected enough bottles, you can clean them thoroughly by washing them with soap and water, and removing any labels or caps. This step is important to ensure that the bottles are clean and safe to use.\n\n2. Drink beer or empty the bottles -> step2. Purchase beer from store\n\nAfter cleaning the bottles, you can either drink the beer inside them or empty the bottles and use them as is. If you choose to drink the beer, you will need to purchase more beer to fill the empty bottles. If you choose to empty the bottles, you can use them as is or fill them with a different beverage, such as water or soda.\n\n2. Drink beer or empty the bottles -> step2. Purchase beer from store\n\nIn this step, you purchase more beer to fill the empty bottles. You can buy beer from a local store or online, depending on your preference.\n\n3. Purchase beer from store -> step4. Glue bottles together\n\nOnce you have filled the empty bottles with beer, you can start gluing them together to form a wall. You can use a strong adhesive, such as super glue or hot glue, to bond the bottles together.\n\n4. Glue bottles together -> step5. Choose layout for bottles\n\nIn this step, you decide on the layout for the bottles. You can choose to form a straight line, a curve, or any other shape you prefer. You can also decide on the distance between the bottles to ensure that they are securely attached to each other.\n\n5. Choose layout for bottles -> step6. Decided to build a wall made of beer bottles\n\nIn this step, you decide to build a wall made of beer bottles. You can choose to build the wall in a specific location, such as a backyard or a fence, or you can build it in a more creative location, such as a garden or a patio.\n\n6.
