Visit node 2.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start at node 0: This is the starting point of the graph, so we begin our tour here.\n2. Visit node 0: Since node 0 should be visited before nodes 1 and 2, we visit it first.\n3. Visit node 1: Since node 0 has already been visited, we can now visit node 1.\n4. Visit node 2: Finally, we visit node 2, which is the last node in the graph.\n\nBy following this sequence, we have visited all the nodes in the graph in the correct order."}
