Therefore, there is no path between node 12 and node 17.\n\nConclusion:\nThe answer to the question is no. There is no path between node 12 and node 17.\n\nWill you like to know the answer to the next question?"}

Since node 23 is connected to node 3, the path from node 21 to node 16 is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. There is no path between node 21 and node 16."}

We are given the matrix representing the graph. The nodes are represented by integers. The edges are represented by integers. The weight of each edge is represented by a non-negative integer.
